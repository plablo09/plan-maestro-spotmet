# Product Guidelines

## Communication Tone
The project's communication should be **Professional and Analytical**, focusing on data accuracy, transparency, and objective policy implications. This tone is specifically chosen to effectively reach and engage public officials.

## Visual Aesthetic
The 3D map and user interface will feature a **Minimalist and Dark-Themed** aesthetic. A high-contrast dark background for the map will make the 3D buildings and their respective color mappings stand out clearly, emphasizing the spatial data.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Clarity and Focus:** The 3D building data and key metrics (such as overbuilt volume) must remain the focal point of the application.
- **Narrative Flow:** The interface will guide users through a logical sequence: from permitted levels, to registered heights, and finally to the observed discrepancies.
- **Interactive Discovery:** Users will be able to click on individual buildings to access detailed information, fostering a deeper understanding of the specific data points.
