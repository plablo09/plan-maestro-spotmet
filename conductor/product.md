# Initial Concept
The project is a 3D building compliance visualization for Mexico City (CDMX). It aims to communicate, mainly to public officials, the discrepancies between planned heights, registered heights in the cadaster, and actual built heights. It's a communication tool to foster the idea that we need better policy and technological tools to continuously assimilate data.

# Product Definition

## Vision
To provide a clear 3D visualization of building heights versus permitted levels in CDMX. This tool serves as a bridge between urban planning, official registries, and physical reality, advocating for more sophisticated policy and data-driven governance.

## Target Users
The primary users are urban planners and city officials who need to understand the policy-reality gap in urban growth.

## Core Features
- **Narrative Mode & Interactive Legend:** A user experience designed to explain the meaning of colors, heights, and discrepancies, making complex geospatial data accessible and actionable for policy discussions.
- **3D Visualization:** Comparative views of building heights (planned, registered, and eventually actual).
- **Discrepancy Analysis:** Visualizing the differences between zoning rules and what is actually on the ground.

## Future Priorities
The next phase will focus on refining the interactive narrative and user interface to better communicate policy implications, ensuring the data effectively supports the case for improved urban oversight tools.
